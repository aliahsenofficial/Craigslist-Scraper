ABOUT THE MEDINA RIVER  This underrated gem offers a few advantages over other tubing rivers: It‚Äôs never too crowded; its calm, easy flow is great for a lazy float; and the twisting river offers plenty of opportunities for short- to long-range journeys, from two-hour trips to multi-day adventures. The Medina River was named after Pedro de Medina, a Spanish cartographer, by Alonso de Le√≥n, Spanish governor of Coahuila, New Spain in 1689. It once served as the official boundary between Texas and Coahuila[2] with the San Antonio River being considered its tributary. At that time, the river was called the Medina all the way to the Gulf of Mexico, but now the part below the confluence is called the San Antonio River. The Medina River is located in south central Texas, United States, in the Medina Valley. It was also known as the Rio Mariano, Rio San Jose, or Rio de Bagres (Catfish river). Its source is in springs in the Edwards Plateau in northwest Bandera County, Texas and merges with the San Antonio River in southern Bexar County, Texas, for a course of 120 miles. It contains the Medina Dam in NE Medina County, Texas which restrains Lake Medina. Much of its course is owned and operated by the Bexar-Medina-Atascosa Water District to provide irrigation services to farmers and ranchers.
