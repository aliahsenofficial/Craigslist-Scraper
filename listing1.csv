The back two wings are newer and on a concrete slab foundation with brick exteriors.  The area around the building includes a large paved parking area and a large grassy area for outdoor entertainment and enjoyment or expansion.  The property is currently zoned for commercial use, but if it needs to be re-zoned for other uses, the city of San Saba has expressed its willingness to work with new owners to put it back into use or even change the use.

Ask about owner finance options; dueno a dueno, cash and investors welcome.  You can stop paying rent, because seller financing is available! Dueno a dueno.  It's simple, we own the house outright and will act as the bank for you; nothing tricky. It's hard to get a house in this location for this price. This will be an ""as-is"" sale. No prepayment penalty.  This is a true owner finance. $10k down payment with 10% interest on the remaining note. Payment includes the taxes and insurance, which will be escrowed into the payment. You will bring your down payment, and prorated taxes and insurance for the year to closing (which can vary, based on property taxes and insurance selected).  If you have been looking to purchase a house but can’t qualify for a bank loan we may be able to help. This house is for sale and we can Owner Finance with low credit scores. The deed would be transferred into your name which is much better than a rent-to-own.

WHAT IS OWNER FINANCING: *Seller financing is a lot like rent-to-own except for you immediately own the house and the deed is transferred to you. Rent-to-own means you usually have 3 years to buy it or you will forfeit your interest in the property. Owner financing, compared to rent-to-own, comes with rights that make it a lot harder to get kicked out of your house if you are in default as well. You can also potentially write off mortgage interest and property tax on your income tax return.",23 days ago,N/A

The unit is on the third floor of the three story complex, this offers great views over the neighboring buildings as well as very high ceilings.    I have done much to the aesthetic of the apartment.  Paint, kitchen upgrades, washer dryer, removed popcorn ceilings, artificial turf on balcony and privacy shade as well as a few other knick knack thinks.    HOA is $259 there is a pool, hot tub, private parking spot, locked gate, and new management who picking up the slack of the old manager who had been stealing from the HOA to the tune of over a million.  So expect big improvements like paint and new balcony's, and open to suggestions.    Very nice neighbors, pet friendly.     I am sensitive to the banking crisis we are going through, I have it priced where you can not loose money if you plan on keeping it or renting it.  Should be under 1k with a good down payment.

"""Wanna-be"" investors screw themselves. All the info is out there. (Houston)",7572762534,https://houston.craigslist.org/reo/7572762534.html,N/A,"I have seen it time and time again. Thousands of times.  Some group or ""guru"" puts on a show at a conference room or center, then gives some vague motivational shit followed by a pitch to buy into their programs. (that cost you thousands). Or ""investor clubs"" that are run by a bunch of people wanting to sell newbie investors a bunch of crap. Then there are the ""mentors"" who are basically the illegitimate child of a personal injury lawyer and used car salesman who was raised by a pack of gypsies.  Large and small I have seen ""Help"" screw people out of their hard earned money for a line of bullshit that sounds good. Investing in real estate IS the BEST way to build wealth in America today. For both the short term and long term benefits.  But MOST of these people offering ""help"" are trying to separate you from your cash, not build you wealth via real estate. They build a business of ""service"" for wanna-be investors, but preach that type of ""active"" income is not the correct path.   Anyway, I have bought and sold hundreds of homes and dozens of commercial, multi-family, retail, office/warehouse spaces, and I have done VERY well. I don't mentor, I don't ""help"" anyone. I buy and sell (lease) real estate. Thats it.   Occasionally I will pass on a good deal, I get paid for passing it MOST of the time. (friends get free deals because I am not an asshole...completely) And I sell deals all the time once they are done. i.e. rehabbed / rented. I don't have a list, I have some people I know 100% can make shit happen on deals. I don't wholesale because I got tired of people trying to renegotiate w/ people I had contracts w/ or not buying the property and leaving the property owner back at 1. (I buy it no matter what, even if the person I sell to backs out.)

ABOUT THE MEDINA RIVER  This underrated gem offers a few advantages over other tubing rivers: It’s never too crowded; its calm, easy flow is great for a lazy float; and the twisting river offers plenty of opportunities for short- to long-range journeys, from two-hour trips to multi-day adventures. The Medina River was named after Pedro de Medina, a Spanish cartographer, by Alonso de León, Spanish governor of Coahuila, New Spain in 1689. It once served as the official boundary between Texas and Coahuila[2] with the San Antonio River being considered its tributary. At that time, the river was called the Medina all the way to the Gulf of Mexico, but now the part below the confluence is called the San Antonio River. The Medina River is located in south central Texas, United States, in the Medina Valley. It was also known as the Rio Mariano, Rio San Jose, or Rio de Bagres (Catfish river). Its source is in springs in the Edwards Plateau in northwest Bandera County, Texas and merges with the San Antonio River in southern Bexar County, Texas, for a course of 120 miles. It contains the Medina Dam in NE Medina County, Texas which restrains Lake Medina. Much of its course is owned and operated by the Bexar-Medina-Atascosa Water District to provide irrigation services to farmers and ranchers.
